<h2>Why Alf?</h2>

<p>The end of the relational era has been predicted many times since the middle of the '90s. So far, it has not been replaced by XML, nor by Object-Oriented databases, and I strongly predict that it won't be superseded by NoSQL technologies.</p>

<p>Like a few others, I'm personally convinced that the so-called 'relational model' will stay. There are very good reasons for this, most of them have been explained in depth elsewhere. At the heart of our certainty the fact that the relational <strong>is</strong> a theory: a <strong>sound</strong>, <strong>mathematical</strong>, <strong>powerful</strong>, and <strong>simple</strong> theory. Almost all 'alternatives' are not.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the relational theory is as unknown (or at least ill-known) as it is powerful. Therefore, continuous effort is required to help people knowing what relational is about, what we would strongly miss if it had to be thrown away.</p>

<p>Two kinds of such efforts are needed: writings and tools. Alf mostly belongs to the second category. It is a relational tool, more precisely a pragmatic implementation of a flavor of <strong>relational algebra</strong>. You can use it both in Ruby and in Shell, using .csv files, DBMS tables, log files, or whatever you want as input data sources.</p>

<p>Yep, Alf is not about SQL. It is not even about databases, in fact. The relational theory covers a lot of co-related yet orthogonal concepts. One of them is the relational algebra. The latter is often seen as an <em>old-fashioned way of writing database queries</em>. I would be tempted to retort that elementary algebra must be an <em>old technique to solve problems of the ancient city of Babylon</em>. It is not.</p>
